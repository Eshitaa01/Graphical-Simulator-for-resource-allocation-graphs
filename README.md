# Graphical-Simulator-for-resource-allocation-graphs
A Graphical simulator that visulaizes resource allocation graphs and detects deadlock
It helps in identifying circular dependencies that lead to deadlocks.
The project is divided in three modules.
Module one is graphical representation in which process and resources and their relations are stored using a directed graph.
Module two is the detection of deadlocks in which if a circular dependency is present, a deadlock will be detected otherwise it will show no deadlock detected.
Module three is the gui which displays the graph , allows user to add processes and resources, allocate and request resources and show deadlock alerts.
The technologies that are used are python, NetworkX , Matplotlib and tkinter.
